# ArchCompiler
This compiler was built as a university project, from an abstract idea of how compilers work. I’ve done zero research on the innerworkings of compilers before starting this project, hence why it doesn’t follow a lot of practices that would make it more stable and comprehensive. In a lot of ways, it’s quite buggy and will not be able to evaluate each expression properly, it was made to do some thing well, not all of them. This may just be the first iteration of the compiler concept, since I may make another one following better practice and with takeaways from the first iteration (such as an introduction of a lexer like tokenizer and an abstract idea assembler (an assembler that would compile code from an idea of action, such as addition of 2 numbers)).
